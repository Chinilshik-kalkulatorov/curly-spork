### Example Problem

**Problem:**
Water flows through a pipe that narrows from a diameter of 0.1 m to 0.05 m. If the velocity of the water in the wider section is 2 m/s, find the velocity in the narrower section and the pressure difference between the two sections. Assume no energy losses.

**Solution:**

1. **Velocity Calculation:**
   Using the continuity equation \(A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2\):

   ```
   A_1 = \pi \left(rac{0.1}{2}
ight)^2 = 0.00785 \, 	ext{m}^2
   ```

   ```
   A_2 = \pi \left(rac{0.05}{2}
ight)^2 = 0.00196 \, 	ext{m}^2
   ```

   ```
   0.00785 \cdot 2 = 0.00196 \cdot v_2
   ```

   ```
   v_2 = rac{0.00785 \cdot 2}{0.00196} = 8 \, 	ext{m/s}
   ```

2. **Pressure Difference Calculation:**
   Using Bernoulli's equation:

   ```
   rac{v_1^2}{2} + rac{p_1}{
ho} = rac{v_2^2}{2} + rac{p_2}{
ho}
   ```

   ```
   rac{2^2}{2} + rac{p_1}{
ho} = rac{8^2}{2} + rac{p_2}{
ho}
   ```

   ```
   2 + rac{p_1}{
ho} = 32 + rac{p_2}{
ho}
   ```

   ```
   rac{p_1 - p_2}{
ho} = 30
   ```

   If \(
ho = 1000 \, 	ext{kg/m}^3\):

   ```
   p_1 - p_2 = 30 \cdot 1000 = 30000 \, 	ext{Pa} 	ext{ or } 30 \, 	ext{kPa}
   ```
